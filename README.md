<h1 align="center">Hello world, DuÅ¡an here! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>

My name is DuÅ¡an. I am a final year **Software Engineering and Information Technologies** student at the **Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad**.

I am learning cybersecurity, backend development and DevOps, but I also seek knowledge in many different areas in IT. Shell scripting, task automation, CI/CD and making things work are some of the things I do. CTFs are one of my favourite ways of learning.

Also, I am in love with [80s music](https://youtu.be/CdqoNKCCt7A). ðŸŽ·
