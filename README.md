<h1 align="center">Hello world, DuÅ¡an here! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>

My name is DuÅ¡an. I am a master's student in **software engineering**, a **DevOps engineer** and a **cybersecurity enthusiast**.

I enjoy playing with Linux, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and many other tools to keep things running smoothly, secure, and make development easier. Hacking is my sport and I actively engage in CTF competitions â€” I represented Serbia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ in multiple international cybersecurity competitions, including European Cyber Security Challenge. Currently, I am pursuing Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) certification. ðŸ“š

When not hacking, I play the guitar, watch old movies and pretend to be a DJ. Also, I am in love with [80s music](https://youtu.be/CdqoNKCCt7A). ðŸŽ·
