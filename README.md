<h1 align="center">Hello world, DuÅ¡an here! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35"></h1>

My name is DuÅ¡an. I am a master **Software Engineering and Information Technologies** student at the **Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad**.

Passionate about cybersecurity, DevOps, and backend development. Playing CTFs is my sport, and ECSC is my Champions League; produly represented Serbia ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡¸ twice in a row. I also enjoy automating everything, seeing green ticks on CI/CD, and just making things work in general.

Also, I am in love with [80s music](https://youtu.be/CdqoNKCCt7A). ðŸŽ·
